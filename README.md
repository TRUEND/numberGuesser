# Learning C# my first application in c\#
###### Console game guessing number

So I learned a little bit about console which was fun.

##### What I learned

* Console and its some proprieties
* A little bit about how c# works as an object programming language
* Learned about functions(methods) and how they work
* Learned about loop (I only used while but i don't think it's difficult the others)
* Proprieties how to use and set them up.


I think that it, there was a little bit more but I don't think it's relevant to point out right now
After this experience I kind enjoy the way c# works it's very clean code ... and it's easy to me because 
I come from other's languages like PHP, JavaScript, and I do know a little bit of C and Python :)
